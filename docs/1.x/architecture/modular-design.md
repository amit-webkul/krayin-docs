# Modular Design

**Modular design** is the preferred approach for SMEs and Enterprises for complete customer lifecycle management software, as it enables the separation of each package and empowers users to work with self-contained modules.

This architectural style effectively manages the complexity of the system by breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable modules.

To implement this modular approach, Krayin utilizes the [Concord package](https://github.com/artkonekt/concord).

Concord plays a pivotal role in enabling the modular architecture within **Krayin**, providing the necessary tools and features.

By leveraging **Concord**, **Krayin** is able to follow a modular architecture that enhances **flexibility** and **scalability**.

Through Concord, Krayin users can take advantage of the benefits offered by a modular architecture, enabling them to easily customize and extend the software according to their specific requirements.
