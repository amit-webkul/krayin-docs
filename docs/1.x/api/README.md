## REST API

The Krayin REST API supports REST (Representational State Transfer) and provides access to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also supports pagination to increase the performance of the application. The Krayin REST API can be used to build a PWA (Progressive Web Application) application, integrate an online shopping mobile application with the Krayin store.
